Strawberry Shopify Extension
=============

![](logo.png)

A very opinionated extension that does some (hopefully) useful things on Shopify stores.

### Installation
* Download the [the `dist` archive](https://github.com/strawberry/shopify-chrome-extension/blob/master/dist.zip?raw=true) and unpack it.
* In Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
* Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right to _on_.
* Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory you just unzipped.

### Features

#### Quick-Copy Theme IDs
On the themes page in the admin panel, the theme's ID will be printed in the theme's row. Clicking on the ID will copy it to your clipboard.

#### Quick-Copy Preview URL
In the same vein, click the 'Copy preview URL' under a theme to copy the theme's preview URL to your clipboard.

#### Compact Admin Bar
On the frontend of any Shopify site, the standard admin bar which shows you which theme you're currently previewing is made much more compact. Only the theme's name and a close button remains.
